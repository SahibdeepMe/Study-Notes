🧠 Study Notes Repository ⚡
Welcome to the Study Notes Repository, a dynamic and interactive hub for exploring complex scientific and technical concepts in an easy-to-digest format.
This repository hosts a collection of HTML documents, each dedicated to a major topic. The main index page provides a visual,
"shorts-style" preview of the content, allowing you to get a quick animated glimpse before diving into the full chapter notes.



✨ Project Features
Interactive Index (index.html): A modern, responsive index page that acts as the entry point to the notes.
Animated Previews: Each chapter card displays a looping, changing text snippet to simulate a short video or reel preview of the core concepts.
Single-Click Navigation: Click any card to be instantly redirected to the full, detailed notes file for that chapter.
Responsive Design: Optimized for easy viewing on both desktop and mobile devices.


🌐 How to View the Notes (The Live Website)
To see the interactive hub in action (and not just the code), you must view the repository as a hosted website using GitHub Pages.
Find the Live URL: Go to the GitHub repository settings, click on Pages, and find the URL where the site is published.
(The URL will typically be: https://[Your-Username].github.io/[Repository-Name]/)
Open the URL: Navigate to that live website link.
Start Exploring: Click on the animated cards to jump directly to the detailed notes for each subject.
